            <h4>Joining college was both an exciting and overwhelming experience 
                for me. As a finance and computer science major, I wanted to immerse 
                myself in both the academic and social aspects of college life. 
                Early on, I wanted to find STEM-related clubs to connect with 
                people of similar interests. I joined various organizations 
                focused on computer science, finance, and technology, which helped 
                me build technical skills, collaborate on projects, and attend 
                networking events. These clubs not only provided valuable learning 
                experiences but also introduced me to mentors and peers who have 
                guided me along the way. At the same time, I wanted a well-rounded 
                college experience, so I decided to join a sorority. Becoming part 
                of Greek life gave me a sense of community, leadership opportunities,
                 and lifelong friendships. As the secretary of my sorority, I have 
                 taken on the responsibility of organizing executive board meetings, 
                 which has strengthened my communication and organizational skills.
                 Balancing my involvement in STEM clubs and my sorority has allowed 
                 me to grow academically, socially, and professionally. Through 
                 these experiences, I have gained confidence, built lasting 
                 relationships, and developed a strong sense of belonging in my college 
                 journey.</h4>
