        <h4>Joining college was both an exciting and overwhelming experience 
            for me. As a finance and computer science major, I wanted to immerse 
            myself in both the academic and social aspects of college life. 
            Early on, I wanted to find STEM-related clubs to connect with 
            people of similar interests. I joined various organizations 
            focused on computer science, finance, and technology, which helped 
            me build technical skills, collaborate on projects, and attend 
            networking events. These clubs not only provided valuable learning 
            experiences but also introduced me to mentors and peers who have 
            guided me along the way. At the same time, I wanted a well-rounded 
            college experience, so I decided to join a sorority. Becoming part 
            of Greek life gave me a sense of community, leadership opportunities,
             and lifelong friendships. As the secretary of my sorority, I have 
             taken on the responsibility of organizing executive board meetings, 
             which has strengthened my communication and organizational skills.
             Balancing my involvement in STEM clubs and my sorority has allowed 
             me to grow academically, socially, and professionally. Through 
             these experiences, I have gained confidence, built lasting 
             relationships, and developed a strong sense of belonging in my college 
             journey.</h4>
