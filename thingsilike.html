        <h4>Snowboarding is one of my favorite pastimes, offering an 
            exciting mix of aadventure on the mountain. Whether it's carving 
            down a fresh powder slope or spending the day on the mountain 
            with friends, there's always an excitement that comes with every day. 
            I love the camaraderie that comes with snowboarding, where 
            friends can push each other to improve while having fun at the same time.
            When we're not on the slopes, we bond over *New Girl*, a show that 
            always brings us together. The fun dynamics of the group of characters resonate 
            with us and often become the backdrop for our conversations. Whether it's 
            quoting funny lines from the show or debating which character we are most like,
             *New Girl* never fails to provide a good laugh. These interests, snowboarding and *New Girl*, 
             are just a few of the things that make spending time with my friends so 
             enjoyable.</h4>
